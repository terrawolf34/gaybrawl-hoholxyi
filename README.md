### Requirements:

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then __`python main.py`__

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. 
Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/zDQzDYyB#V7GkrTFQpTfhTk_gOroMfdps5VFl8Lnn-CBX-bbnjlw) and change the IP in `libcb.config.so`, if you want to use Classic Brawl locally on your device, you can use "127.0.0.1" as the IP. If not, then you can use your device's IPv4 address. 

#### The APK was recently updated to support Android 13+ and Emulators.
